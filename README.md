# MutExMatSorting
Mutual Exclusivity Sorting of Binary Matrices 

This package implements an heuristic algrorithm that takes in input a sparse binary matrix and sorts its rows and column in a way that the patterns of non null entries have a minimal overalp across rows. This highlights possible mutual exclusive trends among these patterns.
